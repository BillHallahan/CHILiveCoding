\begin{abstract}
Live programming is a novel approach for programming practice. Programmers are given real-time feedback when writing code, traditionally via a graphical user interface. Despite live programming's practical values, such as providing an easier overview of code and better understanding of its structure, it is not yet widely used. In this work, we extend live programming to general purpose code editors, which allows for live programming to be used by programmers, and provides new interfaces for understanding and changing the functionality of code. To achieve this we extended a fully-featured IDE with the ability to show input/output examples of code execution, as the programmer is writing code. Furthermore, we integrate programming by example (PBE) synthesis into our tool by allowing the user to change the shown output, and have the code update automatically. Our goal is to use live programming to give novice programmers a new way to interact and understand programming, as well as being a useful development tool for more advanced programmers.
% Programming by example is a powerful approach to program synthesis: the main idea is
% a programmer will provide a few 
% representative examples, indicating her intentions, and then a PBE tool will
% automatically generate code satisfying those examples.
% While the theoretical foundations of the PBE paradigm continue to expand the potential for synthesis, the PBE approach is not widely used by everyday programmers.
% This is in part due to the lack of a native interface to support this new paradigm of programming.
% We propose using live programming to help novice programmers better understand examples as a mode of programming.
