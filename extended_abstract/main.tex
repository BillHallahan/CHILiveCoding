\begin{abstract}
In this work, we extend the live programming paradigm to general purpose code editors.
In live programming, programmers are given realtime feedback when writing code,
traditionally via a graphical user interface.
Here, we extending a traditional code editor with the ability to show input/output examples of code execution,
as the programmer is writing code.
Furthermore, we integrate the programming by example (PBE) synthesis approach,
allowing the user to change the shown output, and have the code updated automatically.
We propose using live programming to help novice programmers better understand examples as a mode of programming.
% Programming by example is a powerful approach to program synthesis: the main idea is
% a programmer will provide a few 
% representative examples, indicating her intentions, and then a PBE tool will
% automatically generate code satisfying those examples.
% While the theoretical foundations of the PBE paradigm continue to expand the potential for synthesis, the PBE approach is not widely used by everyday programmers.
% This is in part due to the lack of a native interface to support this new paradigm of programming.
% We propose using live programming to help novice programmers better understand examples as a mode of programming.
