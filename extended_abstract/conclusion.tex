\section{Conclusion}
By combining live debugging and programming by example,
our methodology offers programmers a useful work environment.
Live debugging offers rapid feedback as code is written and modified. 
When the user encounters unexpected output, they have two options.
The user can go back to the code, detect
the source of the error, and correct it manually.
However, they can also adjust that output value directly,
and rely on programming by example to ensure the program gives the expected output.
