\section{Implementation}
We have implemented our live programming methodology as a plugin for the Atom text editor~\cite{Atom}.

\subsection{Synthesis}
When a user modifies an examples output, we update the code to reflect the change.
To synthesize code, we make use of CVC4's Syntax-guided synthesis (or SyGuS) algorithm~\cite{reynolds2017sygus}.
SyGuS is an approach that performs an enumerative search over the space of possible programs,
based on a given grammar.
We draw possible grammatical elements from the existing function implementation.
This both helps ensure that the newly generated code does not stray too far from the programmers original implementation,
and helps constraint the space CVC4 has to search over.
If we fail to find a solution to the SyGus problem, we iteratively increase the size of the grammar~\bill{Mark, more about how this is done?}.
